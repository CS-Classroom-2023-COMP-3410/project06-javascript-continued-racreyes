Feature 1- Accurately Calculate Overall Accuracy To Display At the end:
    - This feature was supposed to calculate the overall accuracy of typing based off how many wrong letters was typed compared to the entire stream of words. It is a common feature on most keyboard typers as most typers care about accuracy and how fast they are typing. 
    - This feels like a reasonable feature to have especially since you are just tracking the words typed, which seems to be working due to it highlighting the incorrect letters automatically. As well as just calculating the average of how accurate those letters are. 
    - Its supposed to work by displaying like a 97% score at the end of I got something wrong in the process but it instead just displays 100% accuracy even though at one point, throughout typing it seemed to be calculating it accurately as I was typing. 
    - It seems ChatGPT got the the part of just the final step of displaying the right accuracy once I was done typing
    EDIT:
    - After trying a new feature I realized, it was correctly calculating accuracy but the problem was the criteria it used to make a test done which was that everything needed to be right and it wasn't including the errors the user made throughout typing

Feature 2 - Add a timer feature
    - it correctly implemented this feature including starting when the user is typing

Feature 3 - Add feature to keep adding words in the timer feature so you can keep typing until the timer is up.
    -This feels like a reasonable feature as what would be the point of a timer if not to keep typing until the timer is up. It just reuses the same words so it just be managable to add a new set of words after the condition of reaching the last word is met.
    - It was supposed to work where after a set of words had been typed out, it will display a new set of words adding to the the wpm and accuracy accurately. 
    - While this feature is done right, the wpm doesn't accruately reflect the changes and after several attempts to fix it. The wpm remains around 1000 with this new feature which is literally impossible to accomplish.
